# Monads

Read _"You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Already Have)"_ from the exercises sheet and follow along.

This time, no new examples will be provided, only additional explanations and tips for solving the exercises in the sheet.



## Audit

Function that also **logs** something, aside from returning its value.

### 1 bind

You can think of `bind f` as an "upgraded" `f`, and just write what it does with its argument: `(prevRes, prevLog)`.

Some examples of logging functions:

```haskell
add5 :: Float -> (Float, String)
add5 x = (x + 5, "add5 was called")

divideBy2 :: Float -> Audit Float  -- same as (Float, String)
divideBy2 x = (x / 2, "divideBy2 was called")
```

```haskell
> add5 10
(15, "add5 was called")
```

Composing them using the `bind` function:

```haskell
divideThenAdd :: Float -> (Float, String)
divideThenAdd = (bind add5) . divideBy2
```

```haskell
> divideThenAdd 20
15  -- 20/2=10 +5=15
```

Using the composition operator `#`:

```haskell
divideThenAdd :: Float -> (Float, String)
divideThenAdd = add5 # divideBy2
```



### 2 unit

Remember that `lift f` is a function, so it may be easier to understand if it is written like this:

```haskell
lift :: (a -> b) -> (a -> Audit b)
(lift f) x = unit (f x)
```

Or even:

```haskell
(lift f) x = (f(x), "")
```

Which explains what the _lifted_ `f` does to its argument, `f`: it creates a pair of the normal result `f(x)` and logs nothing (`""`).



## Nondet

Function that returns **multiple** values of the same type – like a list.

### 4 bind

Again, remember to treat `bind f` as a function. It may also be useful to remember what the built-in function `concat` does.

Some example non-deterministic functions:

```haskell
oppositeToo :: Int -> [Int]
oppositeToo x = [x, -x]

plus1n2n3 :: Int -> Nondet Int  -- same as [Int]
plus1n2n3 x = [x + 1, x + 2, x + 3]
```

```haskell
> oppositeToo 5
[5, -5]

> plus1n2n3 10
[11, 12, 13]
```

Composing them:

```haskell
plusOpposites :: Int -> [Int]
plusOpposites = oppositeToo # plus1n2n3
-- or explicitly with the `bind` function: (bind oppositeToo) . plus1n2n3
```

```haskell
> plusOpposites 10
[11,-11, 12,-12, 13,-13]
```



### 5 unit

Just like before, keep in mind that `lift f` should be treated like a function:

```haskell
lift :: (a -> b) -> (a -> Nondet b)
(lift f) x = [f(x)]
```



## Randomized

Function that uses **randomization** in its body, which requires a seed (for generating random numbers).

To avoid getting tangled in notation, it may be useful to remember that `StdGen` can be thought of as a `Seed`. Also `MyRandom a` describes a function that returns an element of type `a` and employs an element of randomness in its body (also returning a new `Seed`).

```haskell
type Seed = StdGen  -- alias
type RandFunc a = Seed -> (a,Seed)  -- instead of MyRandom a
```



If you try to evaluate `uniformNat` on, say `5`, instead of getting a random integer between `0` and `5` you will get an error:

```haskell
> uniformNat 5
error:
  • "No instance for (Show (RandFunc Int))"  -- says it can't print a function
  • "Maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?"  -- good question
```

Let's see what  `uniformNat 5` actually is:

```haskell
> :type (uniformNat 5)
(uniformNat 5) :: RandFunc Int
```

It is a function that returns an integer (and uses some kind of randomness inside)! Of course we can't print it. 

In order to get a result, we also have to pass a `Seed` to it. Luckily we have a seed defined for us - `zeroSeed`:

```haskell
> (uniformNat 5) zeroSeed
(1, 13463877652103410263)  -- the generated integer is 1, the new seed is the long number
```
