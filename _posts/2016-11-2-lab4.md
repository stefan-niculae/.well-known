# High order functions

Functions that take other functions as arguments:

```haskell
> map double [1, 2, 3]  -- apply the function to each element in the list
[2, 4, 6]

> filter isDivisible [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  -- only keep elements where the function returns True
[3, 6]

> foldl customAdd 100 [1, 2, 3]  -- aggeregate elements with the given function starting with the initial value
136   -- 100(initial) + 1(first element) +10(from customAdd)   +   2 +10   +   3 +10
```

This way, the above functions can be rewritten as:

```haskell
squres xs = map square xs
squareEevens xs = map square (filter even xs)
```



# Function composition

The following definitions are equivalent:

```haskell
compound x = double(add5 (x))
compound x = (double . add5) x
compound x = double . add5 $ x  -- different way, less parentheses
compound = double . add  -- ommit the argument all-together

> compound 10
30  -- add5 (becomes 15) then double (becomes 30)
```

This way, the above can be rewritten as:

```haskell
squares = map square
squareEvens = map square . filter even
```



# Lambdas and short-hands

A lambda is an anonymous function, the following are all equivalent:

```haskell
> map double [1, 2, 3]
> map (\x -> x * 2) [1, 2, 3]  -- because \ kind-of looks like a little lambda
> map (*2) [1, 2, 3]  -- currying (more in later labs)

[1, 4, 9]  -- all three yield the same thing
```

This way, the above can be rewritten as:

```haskell
squares = map (^2)
squareEvens = map (^2) . filter even
```
