# Running

On **Unix** (Linux — Ubuntu, etc and macOS) start a terminal and type:

```bash
cd /path/to/lab  # navigate to the lab's folder
ghci <lab>.hs
```

On **Windows** double-click the `<lab>.hs` file (make sure you are _not_ working inside an archive!).

Inside **GHCi** you can enter commands like:

```haskell
> 3 + 4  -- basic arithmetic
7

> length "hello"  -- built-in function
5

> double 41  -- user defined function in the loaded file
82
```

 `:l <other_file>.hs` **loads** another file  (short for `:load`) .

 `:r`  **reloads** the last-loaded file -- used after editing it (short for `:reload`).

**Completion** is available via `tab`, command **history** is via `↑` and `↓`.

**Exit** with `ctrl-D`, **cancel** a command with `ctrl-C`.
