# Running

On **Unix** (Linux -- Ubuntu, etc and macOS) start a terminal and type:

```bash
cd /path/to/lab  # navigate to the lab's folder
ghci <lab>.hs
```

On **Windows** double-click the `<lab>.hs` file (make sure you are _not_ working inside an archive!).

Inside **ghci** you can enter commands like:

```haskell
> 3 + 4  -- basic arithmetic
7

> length "hello"  -- built-in function
5

> double 41  -- user defined function in the loaded file
82
```

 `:l <other_file>.hs` loads another file  (short for `:load`) .

 `:r`  reloads the last-loaded file -- used after editing it (short for `:reload`).

## Installing at home

Follow instructions at [haskell.org/platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

I recommend the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor with the `haskell-language` plugin for syntax highlighting.

For a quick solution, [rextester.com](http://rextester.com/l/haskell_online_compiler) provides an online haskell compiler.
