# Advanced IO

Read the examples for `interact`, `lines`, `unlines`, `words`, `unwords`, `show` and `read` from the exercises sheet.

The `loudEcho` function defined in [Lab 7]({{ site.baseurl }}/lab7#input-output) can now be rewritten using `interact`. First we define a helper function, `yell`, which upper-cases everything we pass:

```haskell
yell :: String -> String
yell = map toUpper
```

For example:

```haskell
> yell "hello"
"HELLO"

> interact yell
abcABC  hiHI
```



# Recap —  Binary Search Tree

Write a module `BST`  which defines an abstract data type `Tree a` representing a Binary Search Tree containing objects of type `a`:

Then we define the data structure, a tree can either be empty (a `Leaf`) or have a left and right child (`Tree`s as well):

```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf
            | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
            deriving Show
```



The following tree:

![test tree](assets/test-tree.png)

is represented like so:

```haskell
test_tree :: Tree Int
test_tree = Node 7
              (Node 3
                (Node 1 Leaf Leaf)
                (Node 5 Leaf Leaf))
              (Node 10 Leaf Leaf)
```



## 1 Add

Add a new element to the tree:

```haskell
> add 1 (Node 5 Leaf Leaf)
Node 5 (Node 1 Leaf Leaf) Leaf
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
add :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
add x Leaf = Node x Leaf Leaf
add x (Node v left right) =
  if x <= v
    then Node v (add x left) right
    else Node v left (add x right)
```

</details>



## 2 Build

Build a tree from the given list

```haskell
> buildTree [1, 3, 5]
Node 5 (Node 3 (Node 1 Leaf Leaf) Leaf) Leaf
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
buildTree :: Ord a => [a] -> Tree a
buildTree = foldr add Leaf
```

</details>



## 3 Search

Whether the given element is contained in the tree:

```haskell
> search 3 test_tree
Just 3

> search 100 test_tree
Nothing
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
search :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Maybe a
search _ Leaf = Nothing
search x (Node v l r) | x == v    = Just v
                      | x < v     = search x l
                      | otherwise = search x r
```

</details>



## 4 Traversal

Inorder (left, root, right) traversal of the tree:

```haskell
> inorder test_tree
[1, 3, 5, 7, 10]
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
inorder :: Tree a -> [a]
inorder Leaf = []
inorder (Node v left right) = inorder left ++ [v] ++ inorder right
```

</details>



## 5 Tree Map

Apply the given function to each element of the tree, similar to `map` for lists:

```haskell
> inorder (treeMap (*2) test_tree)
[2, 6, 10, 14, 20]
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
treeMap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
treeMap _ Leaf = Leaf
treeMap f (Node v l r) = Node (f v) (treeMap f l) (treeMap f r)
```

</details>



## 6 Next

For a given element `x` find the next one — the smallest one greater than `x`:

```haskell
> next 4 test_tree
Just 5

> next 100 test_tree
Nothing
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
next :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Maybe a
next x t = if gtx == [] then Nothing else Just (minimum gtx)
  where gtx = filter (>x) (traverse t)
```

</details>



## 7 Interaction

Write another module, `Sorter`, which uses the function from `BST` to sort a list of numbers. The list is entered from the keyboard, numbers delimited by whitespace:

```haskell
Sorter> sortInput
1 5 2 3 6 9
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]
```



At the top of `BST.hs`, list what to export:

```haskell
module BST (Tree,
            buildTree,
            inorder)
where
```

At the top of `Sorter.hs`, import them:

```haskell
module Sorter where
import BST
```

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```haskell
sortInput :: IO [Int]
sortInput = do
  line <- getLine
  let split = words line
  let numbers :: [Int]; numbers = map read split
  let tree = fromList numbers
  return (toList tree)
```
